# Long text for five-minute practice test (includes punctuation and numbers)
FIVE_MINUTE_TEXT = (
    "In 2025, the world is more connected than ever before. People send emails, texts, and photos across continents in seconds. "
    "The sun rises at 6:15 a.m., and by 8:00, the city is alive with the sound of cars, bicycles, and laughter. "
    "Sarah, age 27, checks her calendar: 3 meetings, 2 deadlines, and 1 birthday to remember. She grabs a coffee—two sugars, no cream—and heads out. "
    "On the way, she passes a bakery advertising fresh bread: $2.99 per loaf! The aroma is irresistible, but she’s running late. "
    "At the office, her computer greets her: 'Welcome, Sarah!' She types reports, answers questions, and solves problems. "
    "Lunch is a quick salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and a dash of olive oil), eaten while reading the news. "
    "The headlines: 'Stocks up 1.5%,' 'Rain expected at 4:30 p.m.,' and 'Local team wins 3-2 in overtime.' "
    "By 5:00, Sarah is tired but satisfied. She walks home, counting steps—1, 2, 3, all the way to 1,000. "
    "Dinner is pasta with garlic bread, followed by a slice of chocolate cake. At 9:45, she writes in her journal: 'Today was a good day.' "
    "Before bed, she sets her alarm for 6:00 a.m., turns off the lights, and listens to the quiet hum of the city. "
    "Outside, rain taps gently on the window. Tomorrow, she’ll do it all again—maybe with a little more coffee, and a lot more hope."
